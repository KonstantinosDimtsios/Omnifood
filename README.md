# Omnifood
My very first market-page landing called Omnifood. This page was implemented during my studies in Udemy about HTML and CSS!

⚙️ For this project i have used the following tools / techniques :

- Vanilla Html
- Vanilla Css
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code
- Free deployment on Netlify and Github

You can visit the landing using the following link: https://konstantinosdimtsios.github.io/Omnifood/

🚀 Bellow is a list with some features of the site :

- Different sections (e.g. Hero, How it works etc.).
- Navigation bar / sticky technique / smooth scrolling.
- Animated showcase and functional buttons / sign-up (free dummy database).
- Responsive Web Design for pc, laptop, tablet, mobile phone (supported by most browsers including Safari).
- Lighthouse performance check passed (3/3 green categories)!

✨ Special thanks to mr. Jonas Schmedtmann for his course!
